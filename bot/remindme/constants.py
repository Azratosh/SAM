"""Constants for the remindme command and its parser.

This file contains all the constants used for the ``remindme`` command and
its parser. Every constant is to be used exclusively within the ``remindme``
package.

Note:
    Translations for keywords could be handled in a more elegant way,
    preferably through something like the ``gettext`` package. Implementing
    these translations might require changes to the keywords' data structures
    as well.
